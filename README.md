# School_District_Analysis
## Overview

This analysis focuses on using the pandas library to manipulate DataFrames in the context of acedemic dishonestly; susupicious test results were reported in the 9th grade class at Thomas High School. To avoid skewing acedemic preformance data, the school board elected to drop the reading and math test restuls from Thomas High School's 9th graders and replace them with "NaNs". Using the cleaned data, this project extracts and sumarize statistical information about acedemic preformance on both a school and district level.
